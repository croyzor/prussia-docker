Creates a docker image for developing ps2 applications with [[https://github.com/ZirconiumX/prussia][prussia]].

It is based on the [[https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile][ps2dev-docker]] project developed by Naomi Peori. I switched it back from an alpine to a debian base simply because that's what I'm more comfortable developing with.

* Usage
- Build with =docker build -t prussia .=
- Run with =docker run -v$PWD:/build prussia=

* Note
This isn't as neat as using =ps2dev-docker=, since running a new container means installing project-specific cargo dependencies. It would be preferable to create one container from the =prussia= image and re-use that when doing incremental builds.

* TODO: 
- Is it redundant to install ps2-toolchain /and/ binutils?
- Better handle sourcing from =.cargo/env=
- Switch base back to alpine to reduce size?
